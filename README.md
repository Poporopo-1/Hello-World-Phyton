Summary of the GitHub Experience
Learning Outcome: This task was an excellent opportunity to familiarize myself with Git and GitHub. I learned how to create a repository, link it to a local project, and push my changes.
Challenges Overcome: The biggest challenges were dealing with authentication issues, but using a personal access token solved that problem. Once I got the hang of it, I found the process quite intuitive.
Reflection: GitHub is an essential tool for version control and collaboration. I will continue using it for all my future projects to track code changes and collaborate with others.
